# Documentation Sharding

We've refactored all our documents in @docs/ and spread it to their respective subfolders.

Now we're going to shard the different Readmes to better navigations.

## Rules

- do NOT create or rewrite new sections: your role is to shard the existing documents into smaller documents
- NEVER read or try to access a file listed in .gitignore
- You are running within a fish shell. Use the relevant commands

## Tasks

### Step 1: @docs/archlinux/README.md sharding

**Status**: Pending

- [ ] Every section of the document must be sharded in their respective files.
  - Hyrpland
  - Waybar
  - ...

- [ ] Create an Index.md file, that will contain:
  - the overview
  - the structure
  - Obsidian links ([[filename]]) to the different shards you created
  - other items that do not belong to a shard

- [ ] Update the status of the current step once you're done with it, and move to the next one.

### Step 2: @docs/common/README.md sharding

**Status**: Pending

Similar to Step 1, but this time focusing @docs/common/README.md
- [ ] Every section of the document must be sharded in their respective files.
