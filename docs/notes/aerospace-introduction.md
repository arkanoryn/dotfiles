[Aerospace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) Â is an i3-like tiling window manager for macOS that I am currently trying out in replacement of my current configuration with [Hotkey App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotkey-app/id975890633?mt=12) and [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12).
My goal with using [[Aerospace]], like the other tools is to reduce my usage of the mouse to a minimum, as I am loosing time every time I have to move from my keyboard to my mouse and back.

Therefore it is important to me that my most used apps and windows managements are quickly available.

> I have been using [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) since I bought my first mac in 2013 and it has served me really well.  More than well even. I have been using [Hotkey App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotkey-app/id975890633?mt=12) for the past 6 months and the duo is just amazing to work with. At the snap of a finger, I am able to be on the app I want and resize the windows to the size I need it to be, all from the comfort of my keyboard; on mouse required.
> For my daily work, it was enough.

> But lately I have been working in the evening on personal growth that required me to have more freedom in my management of my windows than what Magnet offers.
> For reference, I am working with a 49 inch monitor. I often work with three windows in front of me evenly split. But now I wanted to have more freedom over their individual sizes, be able to move on them without having to use the mouse. 
> Here comes [[Aerospace]]. As a tiling app, it should do what I expect from it.
> Another bonus is that it can also launch apps (like Hotkey) and when selecting an app or window, it is possible to center the pointer directly in the center of the window, which when you have a big screen is not a small distance at the end of the day.
> Finally it is configured through a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file, which would make it easy for me to move from mac to mac.

> Time will tell if [[Aerospace]] is a good fit for me. For 95% of the other users, I would probably advise them to go with the [Hotkey App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotkey-app/id975890633?mt=12) and [Magnet](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magnet/id441258766?mt=12) setup, especially if they are not developers. Just using these tools right would increase their speed and productivity on a Mac by a lot. Or so I feel.
