[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a terminal multiplexer.

I've seen a lot of people using it with more or less success, depending on the user.
This is my attempt at its trial.

Most information relative to tmux can be found directly from their [getting started guide](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started) and I will not attempt at repeating them. In this file and sub-files, I'll only focus on what matters to me and why I'm making certain decisions and configurations.
