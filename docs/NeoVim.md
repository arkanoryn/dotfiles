> [!info] Keyboard Layout
> My keyboard is still using a [[Graphite]] layout. But I will, in general, reference to the "common" git shortcuts for the reference. And if I feel the need, add the shortcuts that I'm using for [[Graphite]].
> 
> As for now, I don't yet know if and how I'll remap [[NeoVim|vi]] to [[Graphite]], this is a strongly open topic.
## Flash
See official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim#-examples).
Flash is used to quickly jumped within the current buffer to a different position, without having to use the directional keys.

> [!question] What to use it for?
> - One option would be to use the `h,j,k,l` keys to flash, especially the `h` and `l`. But for now I'm unsure.
> - Another thing is to be able to jump through *all* opened windows. In this case `j` would've been the perfect match. But on [[Graphite]], it's on the outside. It's matching letter is `a`. But I don't know yet.

- [ ] decide how to configure the jumps including the jump to windows
## TreeSitter
> The goal of `nvim-treesitter` is both to provide a simple and easy way to use the interface for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) in Neovim and to provide some basic functionality such as highlighting based on it.

See official [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).
