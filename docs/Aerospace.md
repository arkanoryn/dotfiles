# Aerospace

## Introduction
![[aerospace-introduction]]

## Philosophy
![[aerospace-philosophy]]


## Pre-requisites

My configuration of aerospace is working with [[SketchyBar]] and [[Janky_Borders]].
While they are not mandatory, they make the experience a lot nicer.

## Shortcuts
> [!caution]+ Warning! My keyboard layout is **NOT** QWERTY
> For better or for worst, I jumped the rabbit hole of custom keyboard and alternative layouts. I am therefore currently using a [[Graphite]] layout which strongly differ from the default Qwerty one.

> [!faq]+ Hands Repartitions
> We will use the **left** hand for the *applications* management and the **right** hand for the windows management.
> Most shortcuts will turn around the [[home row]] and the equivalent [[NeoVim|Vi]] directional keys `h, j, k, l` - except on the [[Graphite]] layout instead of the infamous QWERTY. We will reuse these as well for most movements of windows. If on the same layers ([[aerospace-mode|modes]]) we must have two rows for actions, we will transpose the same direction on the upper row: `h -> u, j -> i, ...`
